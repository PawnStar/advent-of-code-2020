# Advent of Code 2020

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2020 challenges.

Usage:
```bash
./aoc.js [day] [part] [mode]
```

Where day and part are numbers, and mode is either "sample" or "full".

Example:

```bash
./aoc.js 1 2 full
```

The above command will run the script for day 1, part 2, with the full puzzle
input file.
